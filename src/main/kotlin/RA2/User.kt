/*
What to create (files/classes):
1. User data class with at least id: String, name: String, email: String,
age: Int.
2. A companion object in User that provides a factory method to create users
from name and email (e.g. generate id internally).
3. Email property with setter that validates the basic format (e.g. contains @) â€”
if it does not pass validation, it should not assign the new value.
4. Age property with private set (read-only externally, mutable within the class).
5. Primary constructor + init block that validates initial conditions (e.g. age >= 0 ),
or throws an exception if they are not met.
